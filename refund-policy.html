        <p><strong>Last Updated: April 3, 2025</strong></p>
        
        <p>At <strong>GecnoGuru</strong>, we are committed to providing high-quality services to our customers. We understand that situations may arise where you need to cancel your subscription or request a refund. Please read our Refund & Cancellation Policy carefully to understand your rights and responsibilities.</p>
        
        <h2>1. General Refund Policy</h2>
        <p>All purchases made on our platform are <span class="important">non-refundable</span>. Once a payment has been processed, we do not offer refunds, whether in full or partial, except in the cases explicitly stated in this policy.</p>
        
        <p>If you experience any issues with our services, we encourage you to contact our support team at <strong>teamgecnoguru@gmail.com</strong> or call us at <strong>+91 85474 70675</strong> or <strong>+91 8547349691</strong>, and we will work with you to resolve your concerns.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Subscription Cancellation</h2>
        <p>You may cancel your subscription at any time by logging into your account and navigating to the subscription settings. Your cancellation will take effect at the end of the current billing cycle. You will continue to have access to our services until the expiration of your paid term, and no further charges will be made to your account.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cancelling your subscription <strong>does not</strong> entitle you to a refund for any unused portion of your service.</li>
            <li>If you cancel before the end of the billing period, you will not receive a prorated refund.</li>
            <li>After cancellation, your access to our services will cease once your current subscription period ends.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>3. Exceptions for Refunds</h2>
        <p>Although our policy states that all purchases are non-refundable, we may consider refund requests under the following exceptional circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Duplicate Charges</strong>: If you were charged multiple times for the same service due to a technical error, we will refund the duplicate charge upon verification.</li>
            <li><strong>Service Malfunction</strong>: If you have experienced technical difficulties that significantly impact your ability to use our services and we are unable to resolve the issue, you may be eligible for a partial or full refund at our discretion.</li>
            <li><strong>Fraudulent Transactions</strong>: If an unauthorized transaction was made on your account, please notify us immediately so we can investigate and take appropriate action.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>To request a refund under these circumstances, please email <strong>teamgecnoguru@gmail.com</strong> with details of your issue, transaction details, and any relevant supporting documentation. Refund requests will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, and we reserve the right to approve or deny any request at our discretion.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Chargebacks & Disputes</h2>
        <p>Initiating a chargeback with your bank or payment provider without contacting us first may result in the permanent suspension of your account. If you have concerns about your payment, we strongly encourage you to reach out to our support team before disputing a charge.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify or update this Refund & Cancellation Policy at any time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting on our website. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about our terms.</p>
